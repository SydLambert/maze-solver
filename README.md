# [Maze Solver](https://sydlambert.com/projects/maze)
An HTML5 maze generator & solver with a Commodore Plus/4 theme. Allows you to generate and solve mazes of various sizes using a selection of algorithms. I decided to give it the Commodore theme to add a little variety. The display uses HTML5 canvas and the CSS is responsive.
